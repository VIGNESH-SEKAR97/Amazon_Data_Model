# Amazon_Data_Model
## Project Overview

**Amazon_Data_Model**: Amazon Sales Dataset Data Model

**Level**: Beginner  

This dataset contains 100,000 synthetic Amazon-style e-commerce sales transactions, designed to closely resemble real-world online retail behavior. With 20 clean and well-structured columns, it captures detailed information about customers, products, pricing, payments, logistics, and order outcomes.

## Objectives

1. **Normalize Large Tables**: Applied normalization techniques to organize data within a relational database, minimizing redundancy (duplicate data) and improving data integrity.
2. **Establish Related Tables and Define Relationships**: Decomposed large tables into smaller, meaningful, and well-structured relational tables while clearly defining the relationships between them.
3. **Develop a Data Model**: Designed a comprehensive data model based on the normalized Amazon sales data tables.
